In this project, we will see how to train a logistic regression model. This is intended as an introduction to logistic regression.
We will be working on [Breast Cancer Dataset available on kaggle]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data')
We will be working with the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains some very detailed measurements of cells.
Along with each observation of measurements, we have the diagnosis of the cell (malignant or not). Our goal is to train a model that will be able to predict whether or not a given cell is malignant given only its measurements.
